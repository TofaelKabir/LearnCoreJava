// How to solve indentation issue?
// 1) to solve a single line: control/command+i
// limitation of number 1: it can't remove the white space

// 2) how to solve multiple lines? (not practiced)
// control/command+a TO SELECT ALL
// control/command+i
// limitation: it can't remove white space

// always use below command, above info is for the info that they cannot remove white space
// what is the final solution for indentation issue/problem?
// shift+control/command+f
// advantage: it can also remove white space (but can't remove from inside of the String)
// When your coding is done, always follow shift+control/command+f  and then save all (shift+control/command+s)

// how to save a single class -- control/command+s
// how to save all the classes opened -- shift + control/command+s
