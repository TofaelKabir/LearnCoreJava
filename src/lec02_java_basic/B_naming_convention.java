// Class names are usually nouns or noun phrases

// Project, package, Class name follow the Camel case feature or Snake case pattern.

// Camel case feature considered from second word (not from the first word)
// There is No spaces between words, and next words start with Upper case always
// Camel case example for a Project --> LearnJavaWithFun
// Camel case example for a package --> lec01JavaBasic
// Camel case example for a Class --> HelloWorld

// Alternative example of Camel case (Called snake_case pattern).
// Snake case feature considered from second word, (not from the first word)
// when we use snake case feature, we use underscore from second word, there is no more upper case
// Snake case feature is more readable
